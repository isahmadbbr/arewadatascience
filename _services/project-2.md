Description:

Task prizing has been a major motivation for the crowdsource-based software development business model. Over-pricing may result in unnecessary extra cost, underpricing may result in task starvation. Therefore, proper prizing is critical for ensuring task success as well as saving cost of task requesters. This project will examine task requirements and pricing structures and develops predictive models for estimating reasonable prize to optimize task success and worker benefits. Programming skills: text mining, machine learning, visualization
