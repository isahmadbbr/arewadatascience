# Description

Sports competition judgement, ranking books, movies, or candidates
as well as prediction of election outcomes all involve various scoring
systems by multiple judges, experts, models or systems. One of the
many challenges is how to combine these multiple scoring systems
to reach  a final scoring system (or ranking system) which is fair,
accurate, and effective. This project explores figure skating competition
judgement using machine learning techniques and combinatorial fusion
algorithms. Both score and rank combinations are considered and
participants will learn the pros and cons of each combination and
apply  this insight to their everyday life and future career.



# Objectives and Learning Goals

Participants, after completing the project, will have achieved
the following learning and research objectives:

- Learned the basic concepts of scoring and ranking in everyday life
    w.r.t. competition, judgement, prediction or decision making.
- Learned the fundamental difference between scoring and ranking
   items in a data set and the diversity between multiple judges,
   experts, models, systems, and algorithms.
- Learned how to best form a group (or committee) of judges, experts
    or professionals as well as algorithms, systems, softwares or models.
- Learned how to catch a cheater in a competition judgement or an
    intruder in information and cyber security.
