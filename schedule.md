As part of our desire and motivation to train marginalized students, **Arewa Data Science Academy** already have student mentoring programs. We offer Nigerian university students seminars on data science, machine learning and related fields. We also offer free training on weekends to affected marginalized students. This year (2023), we are offering a more structured and sreamlined training, being sponsored by **Google Research** and **HausaNLP, Bayero University Kano**. We are targeting underrepresented groups including but not limited to Women and Students from rural communities and communities affected by insecurity.

## Application

The interested students apply through our [online application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iyzuOSp_gvZeWnFgIC_5RG4fNOIeRn4vymVkaUZZTXE/edit?usp=drive_web).

 - **You don't have to be a CS student to apply.**     
 - The priorities will be given students from underrepresented groups. However, we welcome everyone who is interested in computer science research.
 - During the application, you need to write and essay describing your motivation and what you aim to achieve in the fellowship. 
 - Before applying, you need to complete the  Udacity's "Introduction to Python Programming" course. 

 

----

## Research Schedule

- The fellowship will span for period of **16 weeks**. The goal of the fellowship is for the students to train students on machine learning theories and eventually become able to solve research problems.
 
- During the fellowship, we also plan to guide students through online courses and mentorship on how they can acquire the necessary background and requirements to apply and get into competitive graduate programs.

- Students will work on group projects throughout the peroid of the fellowship.

- At the end of the program, each group will present a poster in the **poster competition** session during the workshop.

- All the activities will be completed **online**.
