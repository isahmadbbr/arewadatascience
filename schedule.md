Sponsored by **Google Research**, **Fordham University**,
**University of Connecticut** and **Stevens Institute of Technology**
have teamed up to provide a 8-week computer science research
experience to students in the tri-state area. We welcome
students from all underrepresented minority groups, including but not limited to Women, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, First-Generation College students and beyond.

----

## Application

The interested students apply through our [online application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScivxcgj9GIloL09E1TAh5GoQ6RXgr2MLOMojjSphcBZMHnHQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

 - **You don't have to be a CS student to apply.** We have entry-level projects to help you gain experience in basic computer science research.    
 - The priorities will be given students from underrepresented groups. However, we welcome everyone who is interested in computer science research.
 - During the application, you need to select a project that you are interested in. The projects are hosted in three institutions, Fordham University,
 University of Connecticut and Stevens Institute of Technology.

----

## Research Schedule

- Selected students will work on targeted project in a small group for **8 weeks** from
<span style="color:red">February 22nd to April 22nd</span>.
- The faculty mentor of the project will lead the group.
- The students are expected to have a weekly meeting with their mentors.
- At the end of the program, each group will present a poster in the **poster competition** session during the workshop.
- All the activities will be completed **online**.
